# Rock_Paper_Scissors_cpp
## Description
A simple computer vs player Rock Paper Scissors game showcasing various logical statements. The player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects its move. The program then compares both choices and displays the winner. This project demonstrates basic input handling, conditional logic, and random number generation in C++.
## How to play
-Run the program in your console or terminal.
-When prompted, choose your move by entering a number:
  1 → Rock
  2 → Paper
  3 → Scissors
-The computer will randomly select its move.
-The program will display both your choice and the computer’s choice.
-The winner of the round is announced based on the classic rules:
  Rock beats Scissors
  Paper beats Rock
  Scissors beats Paper
-To play again, simply restart the program.
## Features
- Random number generation.
- Generating random numbers within a specific range.
- Using string array to display choices of both the player and the computer.
- Using multiple if/else statements to determine the winner.
- Use of logical operators AND(&) and OR(||).
- Win/lose logic.
## Tech Used
- C++
## Skills
- Applied C++ fundamentals such as variables, arrays, input/output.
- Used conditional logic to implement game rules.
- Implemented random number generation with rand() and srand(time(0)).
- Practiced mapping numbers to choices using arrays.
